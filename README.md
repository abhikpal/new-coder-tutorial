This repository has the code I wrote while following the [new-coder](http://newcoder.io) tutorials.

This repo contains only the fodlers relevant to the five tutorials; website content, therefore has been removed. However, the AUTHORS list (as on July 10<sup>th</sup>, 2015) and the LICENSE file were not deleted.

The new-coder repo (with the files here + the website) can be found ![here](https://github.com/econchick/new-coder)
